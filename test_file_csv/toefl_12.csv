Summarize some relevant information from multiple sources, but important ideas from the sources are omitted or significantly misrepresented, especially ideas that require unfamiliar vocabulary or are complex. Write with limited facility, with language errors obscuring connections or meaning at key junctures between ideas in the text. This text demonstrates a B1 level of writing. It presents clear arguments and attempts to support them, but it lacks complexity, some grammatical accuracy, and coherence. Further practice with grammar, clarifying ideas, and developing arguments would help improve the score. Grammar and Spelling: ""nomadic live"" should be ""nomadic life"" (life is the correct noun). ""as if people get old"" is awkward phrasing. It should be ""as people get older"" or ""when people get old"". ""culturals inputs"" should be ""cultural input"" (cultural is an adjective, and ""input"" is uncountable in this context). ""disadvanteges"" should be ""disadvantages"". ""are surely to consider"" is unclear and grammatically incorrect. It could be rephrased as ""are certainly worth considering"".";55

Based on the evaluation, this text fits within the B2 (57-79) range, as it demonstrates a good understanding of the material and organizes the ideas clearly, but the lack of depth in some parts and grammar issues affect the overall quality. This score reflects that you demonstrate a good understanding of the material but you need to improve on sentence structure, clarity, and elaboration of ideas. More detailed explanations and refinement in grammar would elevate the writing further. The text summarizes the main points of the reading passage and the lecture. The ideas are organized logically, addressing the key points of both the reading and the lecture (polar dinosaurs, leg position, Haversian canals). However, the explanation of each point is somewhat brief, and there is a lack of elaboration on certain ideas (e.g., ""the true behind the leg position"" could be explained more thoroughly). The text has some grammatical mistakes: ""Unlike than modern reptiles"" should be ""unlike modern reptiles.""

Write with limited facility, with language errors obscuring connections or meaning at key junctures between ideas in the text.  The response summarizes the main points from the lecture and the reading but lacks further development or precise language. It also has grammatical issues and some spelling mistakes, which make the text less polished. While the basic ideas are understandable, the writing doesn't show the complexity, clarity, or detail needed for higher levels. The response identifies the main points from both the reading passage and the lecture, which is good. However, the explanations are somewhat brief and lacking in detail. For instance, the mention of ""bone structure and Haversian canals"" could be expanded, and the explanation of the leg position argument is too simplistic. The ideas are somewhat expressed but underdeveloped. There are gaps in content and some significant inaccuracies in the representation of the lecture. Grammar and spelling issues affect overall clarity and connection between ideas. Spelling Mistakes: ""dinosars"" should be ""dinosaurs."" ""harvesian channels"" should be ""Haversian canals.""
